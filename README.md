## CS course projects -- Java

 These are the codes I have done for my CSE8A & 8B course projects at UCSD.
 
- 2048 Game (Part1 Logic)
- 2048 Game (Part2 UI)
- Caesar Cipher
- Critters Fighting Game
- Draw A House
- Slideshow with Sound
- Turtle
- Word Clouds

I found these course projects interesting and wish that I can share them to more people.
Please **do not copy** my codes for course assignments. Otherwise, you will violate the academic integrity.
