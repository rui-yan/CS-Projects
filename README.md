## CS course projects -- Java

 These are the codes I have done for my CS course projects.

- Draw My House
- 2048 Game (Part1 Logic)
- 2048 Game (Part2 UI)
- Caesar Cipher
- Slides with Sound
- Turtle
- Word Pair
- Critters Fighting Game

I found my CS course projects interesting and wish that I can share them to more people.
Please **do not copy** my codes for your course assignments. Otherwise, you might violate the academic integrity.
