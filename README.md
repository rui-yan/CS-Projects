# CS course projects
These are the codes I have done for my CS course projects.
Project 1: Caesar Cipher
Project 2: Word Pair
Project 3: 2048 Game (Logic Part)
... (wait for adding)

Several of them might not be perfect. My codes are uploaded because they are interesting projects and I wish I can share it to more people. Please do not use and copy my codes for course assignments. Otherwise, you might violate the academic integrity.
