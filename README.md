## CS course projects

 These are the codes I have done for my CS course projects.

- Caesar Cipher
- Word Pair
- Turtle Everywhere
- Draw My House
- 2048 Game (Logic Part)
- 2048 Game (Final Version, UI implemented)
- Critters Fighting Game



Several of them might not be perfect. I found my CS course projects interesting and wish I can share them to more people.
Please **do not copy** my codes for course assignments. Otherwise, you might violate the academic integrity.
